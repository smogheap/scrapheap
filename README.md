scrapheap
=========

digital junk drawer


Who?
----

The scrapheap is for everybody!  Its main purpose, however, is to act as
a grab bag for developers who make games just for fun.


What?
-----

Everything is fair game here, from napkin scribbles to high-def animation,
from sticky note dream-inspired ideas to optimized libraries.


Where?
------

Well, it's kind of a location already, the scrapheap.  Maybe one-word question
headings wasn't the smartest way to organize this.


When?
-----

Yeah, this was a dumb idea.
Commit and grab stuff to and from the scrapheap anytime!


Why?
----

'Cause it's fun to share, and 'cause it's fun to flip through a mixture of scraps
from your own works and others.  Browse the scrapheap for inspiration or yank out
some character art to use as temporary bad guys while you focus on coding.
